  service_instance_manifest:
    description: |
      Entire service instance manifest (`name` key will be ignored).
      If manifest cannot be parsed as YAML, adapter assumes that it's base64 encoded to avoid variable interpolation.

  service_binding_manifest:
    description: |
      Entire service binding manifest (`name` key will be ignored). If not specified, service cannot have bindings.
      If specified, each service binding deployment expects to have two errands: `create-service-binding` and `delete-service-binding`.
      `create-service-binding` errand is expected to produce valid service broker API binding response as specified
      in <https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.12/spec.md#body-6>.
      If manifest cannot be parsed as YAML, adapter assumes that it's base64 encoded to avoid variable interpolation.
